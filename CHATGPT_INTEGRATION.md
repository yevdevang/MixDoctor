# ChatGPT Integration for MixDoctor

## Overview
MixDoctor now uses ChatGPT (GPT-4o) to analyze audio files and provide professional mixing recommendations. The AI analyzes technical audio metrics and provides expert-level feedback.

## Implementation

### 1. ChatGPTService (`Core/Services/ChatGPTService.swift`)
- Singleton service that communicates with OpenAI API
- Takes technical audio measurements as input
- Returns structured analysis with quality scores and recommendations
- **API Key**: Hardcoded in the service (line 13) - Users don't need to configure anything

### 2. Updated AudioAnalysisService
- Extracts technical features from audio files
- Sends measurements to ChatGPT for analysis:
  - Peak and RMS levels (dBFS)
  - Dynamic range
  - Stereo width
  - Phase coherence
  - Frequency energy distribution
  - Spectral centroid
  - Zero crossing rate
- Receives AI-powered analysis and recommendations
- Combines technical metrics with AI insights

### 3. What ChatGPT Analyzes
The AI evaluates:
- **Overall Quality** (0-100 score)
- **Stereo Analysis**: Width and imaging assessment
- **Frequency Balance**: Bass, mids, highs distribution
- **Dynamics**: Compression and dynamic range
- **Recommendations**: 3+ actionable suggestions
- **Detailed Summary**: Professional assessment

## Setup Instructions

### **IMPORTANT: Add Your API Key**
1. Open `/Users/yevgenylevin/Documents/Develop/iOS/MixDoctor/Core/Services/ChatGPTService.swift`
2. Find line 13: `private let apiKey = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"`
3. Replace with your actual OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

```swift
private let apiKey = "sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxx" // Your real key here
```

### Get an OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/
2. Sign in or create account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new secret key
5. Copy and paste into the code

## Cost Considerations
- OpenAI charges per API call
- GPT-4o costs approximately $0.005-0.015 per analysis
- Pricing: https://openai.com/pricing
- Monitor usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage

## User Experience
✅ **Users don't need to configure anything**
✅ **No API key input required**
✅ **Works seamlessly when analyzing files**
✅ **Professional AI-powered feedback**

The API key is embedded in your app, so users just:
1. Import audio files
2. Click "Analyze"
3. Get ChatGPT-powered recommendations

## Technical Benefits
- More nuanced analysis than rule-based algorithms
- Natural language recommendations
- Contextual understanding of mixing principles
- Continuously improving as GPT models improve
- Professional audio engineering expertise

## Error Handling
The service includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid API responses
- Network errors
- JSON parsing issues
- API key validation
- Rate limiting

## Testing
After adding your API key:
1. Build the project
2. Import an audio file
3. Run analysis
4. Check console for ChatGPT response logs
5. View recommendations in the UI

## Security Note
⚠️ **Important**: Since the API key is in the code:
- Don't commit to public repositories
- Consider environment variables for production
- Monitor API usage for abuse
- Set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard
- For production apps, consider backend proxy

## Future Enhancements
- Caching repeated analyses
- Batch processing
- Custom prompts per analysis type
- Multi-language support
- Comparison mode for A/B testing
