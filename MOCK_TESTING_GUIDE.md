## ✅ Setup Complete!

I've configured your app to use **MockSubscriptionService** for testing. No App Store Connect needed!

## 📱 How to Test RIGHT NOW:

Run the app on iPhone 17 Pro simulator (or any simulator)

### 2. Test Free Tier (5 analyses limit)

1. **Import an audio file** (Import tab)
2. **Click "Analyze Mix"**
3. **Watch the counter**: You'll see "Free (4/5 analyses remaining)" in Settings
4. **Repeat 4 more times** until you hit the limit
5. **On the 6th attempt**: Paywall appears automatically! 🎉

### 3. Test the Paywall

You'll see:
- ✨ Beautiful gradient background

4. Click "Restore Purchases"
5. 50% chance it finds a "previous purchase"
6. If successful: You're Pro again!
