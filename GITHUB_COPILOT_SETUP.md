# GitHub Copilot API Integration Setup

## ✅ What Changed

The MixDoctor app now uses **GitHub Copilot API** instead of OpenAI's ChatGPT for audio analysis.

## 🔑 How to Get Your GitHub Token

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Classic)

1. Go to GitHub Settings: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "MixDoctor Copilot Access"
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `copilot` (if available)
   - ✅ `read:user`
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)

### Option 2: Fine-grained Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Token name: "MixDoctor Copilot"
3. Expiration: Choose your preference
4. Permissions:
   - Copilot: Read access
5. Generate token and copy it

## 📝 Add Token to the App

1. Open `/MixDoctor/Core/Services/ChatGPTService.swift`
2. Find line 14: `private let copilotToken = "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"`
3. Replace with your token:
   ```swift
   private let copilotToken = "ghp_your_actual_token_here"
   ```

## 🚀 GitHub Copilot API Endpoint

The app is configured to use:
- **Host**: `api.githubcopilot.com`
- **Model**: `gpt-4o`
- **Format**: OpenAI-compatible API

## ✨ Benefits

✅ No separate OpenAI API costs
✅ Uses your existing GitHub Copilot subscription
✅ Same quality AI analysis
✅ Better integration with your GitHub account

## 📊 Usage Notes

- GitHub Copilot API uses your Copilot subscription
- Check your organization's policies if using a team account
- The API is OpenAI-compatible, so the code works seamlessly

## 🧪 Testing

After adding your token:

1. Build and run the app
2. Import an audio file
3. Click "Analyze"
4. Watch the console for:
   ```
   🚀🚀🚀 GITHUB COPILOT SERVICE CALLED 🚀🚀🚀
   📤 Sending request to GitHub Copilot API...

   ✅✅✅ GITHUB COPILOT ANALYSIS RECEIVED SUCCESSFULLY ✅✅✅
   ```

## 🔒 Security

**Important**: Never commit your GitHub token to version control!

Consider using:
- Xcode build configurations
- Environment variables
- Keychain for production apps

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Error: Unauthorized**
- Check that your token has the correct permissions
- Ensure you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription

**Error: Invalid endpoint**
- Verify the host is set to `api.githubcopilot.com`
- Check your network connection

**No Copilot subscription?**
