# 🔒 API Key Security Setup

Your API key has been secured! Here's what was done and what you need to do:

## ✅ What Was Done

1. **Created `.gitignore`** - Prevents sensitive files from being committed
2. **Created `Config.xcconfig`** - Contains your actual API key (NOT in git)
3. **Created `Config.xcconfig.template`** - Template for other developers
4. **Created `Config.swift`** - Safely loads API key from Info.plist
5. **Updated `OpenAIService.swift`** - Now uses secure configuration

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Xcode Project Configuration Required

You need to configure Xcode to use the config file:

### Step 1: Add Config.xcconfig to Project
1. Open `MixDoctor.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select the project in the navigator (blue MixDoctor icon)
3. Select the "MixDoctor" target
4. Go to the "Info" tab
5. Under "Configurations", expand Debug and Release
6. For both Debug and Release:
   - Click on "MixDoctor" dropdown
   - Select "Config" (or "Other..." and choose Config.xcconfig)

### Step 2: Add Config to Info.plist
1. Open `Info.plist` in the MixDoctor folder
2. Add a new key:
   - Key: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Type: String
   - Value: `$(OPENAI_API_KEY)`

### Step 3: Add Config.swift to Build
1. In Xcode, right-click on "Supporting Files" folder
2. Select "Add Files to MixDoctor..."
3. Navigate to and select `MixDoctor/Supporting Files/Config.swift`
4. Ensure "Copy items if needed" is checked
5. Ensure "MixDoctor" target is checked
6. Click "Add"

## 🔐 Security Benefits

- ✅ API key is NOT in source code
- ✅ API key is NOT committed to git
- ✅ Other developers can use their own keys
- ✅ Easy to update without changing code
- ✅ Works with CI/CD (can set environment variables)

## 🤝 For Other Developers

When someone clones your repo:
1. Copy `Config.xcconfig.template` to `Config.xcconfig`
2. Add their own OpenAI API key to `Config.xcconfig`
3. Configure Xcode project (Steps above)
4. Build and run!

## 🔄 If You Need to Change Your API Key

Simply edit `Config.xcconfig` and rebuild. No code changes needed!

## ⚠️ Before You Commit

Make sure to commit these changes:
\`\`\`bash
git add .gitignore
git add Config.xcconfig.template
git add MixDoctor/Supporting\ Files/Config.swift
git add MixDoctor/Core/Services/OpenAIService.swift
git commit -m "🔒 Secure API key configuration"
\`\`\`

**VERIFY**: `Config.xcconfig` should NOT appear in git status!

## 🚫 Never Commit Config.xcconfig

The `.gitignore` file now prevents `Config.xcconfig` from being committed.
Your actual API key is safe!

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Configure Xcode project (Steps 1-3 above)
2. Build the project
3. Commit the security changes
4. Your API key is now secure! 🎉
