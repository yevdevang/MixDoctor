# 🧪 Quick Test Guide - ChatGPT Integration

## Test in 2 Minutes

### Step 1: Run the App
```bash
# Build and run (already done - build succeeded!)
# Just press ▶️ Play in Xcode
```

### Step 2: Import a Test File
1. Tap "Import" tab
2. Select any audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.)
3. File appears in the list

### Step 3: Analyze
1. Tap on the file
2. Tap "Analyze" button (or it starts automatically)
3. **WATCH THE XCODE CONSOLE** 👀

### Step 4: Verify ChatGPT is Working

**You MUST see these in the console:**

### Step 5: See the Results

After analysis completes, you should see:
- Overall score (0-100) - **FROM CHATGPT!**
- Multiple recommendations - **FROM CHATGPT!**
- Technical metrics (stereo, frequency, dynamics)

## If It Doesn't Work

3. Any errors before ChatGPT call?

### Problem 3: API Error
**Example:**
```
❌ ChatGPT API Error (401): Invalid API key
```
**Solution:** Check your API key in ChatGPTService.swift line 14

```
❌ ChatGPT API Error: The Internet connection appears to be offline
```
**Solution:** Check internet connection
