# 🔴 Testing Subscription Cancellation

## ✅ New Feature Added!

I've added a **Cancel Subscription** feature to test the unsubscribe flow.

## 📱 How to Test Cancellation:

### Step 1: Become a Pro User First

1. **Launch the app**
2. **Analyze 5+ tracks** to hit free limit
3. **Purchase subscription** from paywall
4. **Verify**: Settings shows "Pro" ✓

### Step 2: Go to Settings

1. Open **Settings** tab
2. Look at **Subscription** section
3. You'll see:
   - Status: "Pro" with checkmark ✓
   - Button: "Manage Subscription"
   - Button: **"Cancel Subscription"** (red/destructive)

### Step 3: Cancel Subscription

1. **Click "Cancel Subscription"** (red button)
2. **Alert appears**:
   ```
   Cancel Subscription?
   
   Your Pro features will end immediately and you'll 
   return to the Free tier with 5 analyses per month. 
   You can resubscribe anytime.
   
   [Keep Subscription]  [Cancel Subscription]
   ```

3. **Click "Cancel Subscription"** (red button in alert)
4. **Loading state**: Button shows "Cancelling..." with spinner
5. **1 second delay** (simulates network call)
6. **Status updates**: Shows "Free (5/5 analyses)"
7. **Buttons change**: Now shows "Upgrade to Pro" button

### Step 4: Verify Downgrade

1. **Check status**: Should show "Free (5/5 analyses)"
2. **Try analysis**: Should work (you have 5 free)
3. **Analyze 5 times**: Should hit limit again
4. **6th analysis**: Paywall appears
5. **Can resubscribe**: Purchase flow works again

## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cancel and Resubscribe
```
1. Be Pro user
2. Cancel subscription → Downgrade to Free
3. Hit free limit (5 analyses)
4. See paywall
5. Purchase again → Back to Pro
```

### Scenario 2: Cancel Then Change Mind
```
1. Be Pro user
2. Click "Cancel Subscription"
3. Alert appears
4. Click "Keep Subscription" → No change
5. Still Pro ✓
```

### Scenario 3: Cancel During Operation
```
1. Be Pro user
2. Click "Cancel Subscription"
3. While alert open, check status → Still Pro
4. Cancel subscription → Downgraded
5. Immediately try analysis → Uses free tier
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Cancel Attempts
```
1. Be Pro user
2. Cancel → Downgrade to Free
3. Settings now shows "Upgrade to Pro"
4. "Cancel Subscription" button is gone ✓
```

## 🔍 What Happens When You Cancel?

✅ **Immediate Effects:**
- `isProUser` → `false`
- `remainingFreeAnalyses` → `5` (reset)
- Status changes to "Free (5/5 analyses)"
- UI updates automatically (@Observable)

✅ **State Persistence:**
- Cancellation saved to UserDefaults
- Persists across app restarts
- Can't access Pro features anymore

✅ **Can Resubscribe:**
- "Upgrade to Pro" button appears
- Can purchase again anytime
- Returns to Pro status immediately

## 🆚 Real World vs Mock

### Mock Behavior (Current):
- ✅ Cancels **immediately**
- ✅ Resets to 5 free analyses
- ✅ Instant status change

### Real World Behavior:
- ⏰ Cancellation marks subscription for end of billing period
- ⏰ Pro features remain until period ends
- ⏰ Then downgrades to free tier
- ⏰ User charged for current period

**Note:** In production with real RevenueCat:
- User keeps Pro until billing date
- RevenueCat webhook notifies your server
- Graceful degradation after period ends

## 🎬 Complete Test Flow

```bash
# 1. Fresh Start
Launch app → Status: "Free (5/5 analyses)"

# 2. Upgrade
Analyze 5 tracks → Hit limit → Purchase → Status: "Pro" ✓

# 3. Use Pro Features
Analyze 10+ tracks → All work → Unlimited ✓

# 4. Cancel
Settings → Cancel Subscription → Confirm → Status: "Free (5/5)" ✓

# 5. Verify Free Tier
Analyze 5 tracks → Counter decrements: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 ✓
Try 6th → Paywall appears ✓

# 6. Resubscribe
Purchase again → Status: "Pro" ✓ → Unlimited again ✓
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Cancel button not showing?**
- Make sure you're a Pro user first
- Check that `mockService.isProUser == true`

**Cancel doesn't work?**
- Check console for "✓ Subscription cancelled"
- Verify status updates in Settings
- Try restarting app if state is stuck

**Still see Pro status after cancel?**
- Wait 1 second for "network" delay
- Check if alert was confirmed
- Use "Reset to Free User" in paywall as backup
