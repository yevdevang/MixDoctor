# MixDoctor - Project Overview

## Vision

MixDoctor is an intelligent iOS application that analyzes audio files to evaluate mix quality, helping music producers, audio engineers, and enthusiasts identify and understand potential issues in their audio mixes.

## Core Features

### 1. Audio Analysis
- **Stereo Imaging Analysis**: Evaluate stereo width, mono compatibility, and spatial distribution
- **Phase Detection**: Identify phase cancellation issues between left and right channels
- **Balance Analysis**: Assess frequency balance across spectrum (low, mid, high frequencies)
- **Dynamic Range**: Measure and analyze dynamic range and loudness
- **Frequency Analysis**: Detailed spectral analysis with problematic frequency identification
- **Correlation Meter**: Check stereo correlation and phase relationship

### 2. User Interface

#### Import View
- Drag-and-drop audio file import
- Support for multiple audio formats (WAV, AIFF, MP3, M4A, FLAC)
- Batch import capability
- File metadata display

#### Results View
