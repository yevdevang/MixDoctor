# Files to Add to Xcode Project

## Phase 4 Implementation - Missing Files

To complete the build, please add the following files to your Xcode project:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **In Xcode**, ensure the **Project Navigator** is visible (⌘+1)

2. **Add Root-Level Core Files:**
   - Right-click on the **MixDoctor** project (the blue icon at the top)
   - Select **"Add Files to MixDoctor..."**
   - Navigate to: `/Users/yevgenylevin/Documents/Develop/iOS/MixDoctor/Core`
   - Select the **entire `Core` folder**
   - **IMPORTANT:** 
     - ✅ **UNCHECK** "Copy items if needed"
     - ✅ SELECT "Create groups"  
     - ✅ CHECK the "MixDoctor" target
   - Click **"Add"**

3. **Add Features CoreML Models:**
   - Right-click on the **MixDoctor** project again
   - Select **"Add Files to MixDoctor..."**
   - Navigate to: `/Users/yevgenylevin/Documents/Develop/iOS/MixDoctor/Features/Analysis/CoreML/Models`
   - Select all three files:
     - `FrequencyBalanceAnalyzer.swift`
     - `PhaseProblemDetector.swift`
     - `StereoWidthClassifier.swift`
   - **IMPORTANT:**
     - ✅ **UNCHECK** "Copy items if needed"
     - ✅ SELECT "Create groups"
     - ✅ CHECK the "MixDoctor" target
   - Click **"Add"**

4. **Clean and Build:**
   - Press **⇧+⌘+K** (Product → Clean Build Folder)
   - Press **⌘+B** (Product → Build)

### Files Being Added:

#### Root Core Directory:
- ✅ Core/Services/AudioAnalysisService.swift
- ✅ Core/Services/AudioFeatureExtractor.swift
- ✅ Core/Services/AudioProcessor.swift
- ✅ Core/Models/AnalysisResult.swift  
- ✅ Core/Utilities/Constants.swift

#### Features CoreML Models:
- ✅ Features/Analysis/CoreML/Models/FrequencyBalanceAnalyzer.swift
- ✅ Features/Analysis/CoreML/Models/PhaseProblemDetector.swift
- ✅ Features/Analysis/CoreML/Models/StereoWidthClassifier.swift

### Why This Is Needed:

The Phase 4 UI files (DashboardView, ResultsView, PlayerView, etc.) that I created depend on:
- `AudioFile` and `AnalysisResult` models
- `AudioAnalysisService` for running analyses
- `AppConstants` for UI constants
- CoreML models for actual analysis

These files exist in your project but aren't currently included in the Xcode build target.

### After Adding Files:

Once added, the build should succeed and you'll be able to:
- View the Dashboard with file management
- See detailed analysis results
- Use the audio player with channel controls
- Navigate between all views
