# üö® URGENT: API Key Exposed in Git History

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your OpenAI API key was committed to git and GitHub has blocked the push because it detected the secret.

### Step 1: REVOKE THE EXPOSED API KEY

**DO THIS NOW:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Find the key starting with `sk-proj-b_RspNT3Ikr...`
3. Click "Revoke" to disable it
4. Create a NEW API key

### Step 2: Rewrite Git History

We need to remove the API key from git history:

\`\`\`bash
# Reset to the commit before the API key was added
git reset --soft 6915974

# This will unstage all changes but keep your files
# Now stage only the secure files
git add .gitignore
git add Config.xcconfig.template
git add MixDoctor/Supporting\ Files/Config.swift
git add MixDoctor/Core/Services/OpenAIService.swift
git add API_KEY_SECURITY_SETUP.md

# Create a new commit with secure configuration
git commit -m "üîí Add secure API key configuration

- Move API key to Config.xcconfig (not committed)
- Add .gitignore to prevent secrets from being committed
- Add Config.swift for secure key loading
- Update OpenAIService to use secure configuration"
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Update Your API Key

1. Get your NEW API key from OpenAI
2. Edit `Config.xcconfig` and replace with the NEW key:
   \`\`\`
   OPENAI_API_KEY = YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
   \`\`\`

### Step 4: Configure Xcode (IMPORTANT!)

Follow the steps in `API_KEY_SECURITY_SETUP.md` to configure Xcode to use the config file.

### Step 5: Force Push (Careful!)

\`\`\`bash
# Verify Config.xcconfig is NOT in git
git status

# Force push to rewrite remote history
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/chat-gpt-integration
\`\`\`

## üîê Why This Happened

The API key was hardcoded in `OpenAIService.swift` and committed to git. GitHub's secret scanning detected it and blocked the push to protect you.

## ‚úÖ After These Steps

- Old API key is revoked (can't be used)
- New API key is in Config.xcconfig (not in git)
- Git history is clean (no secrets)
- Future commits won't include secrets

## üö´ Remember

NEVER commit:
- API keys
- Passwords
- Tokens
- Certificates
- Any secrets

Always use:
- Config files (in .gitignore)
- Environment variables
- Secure key management systems
