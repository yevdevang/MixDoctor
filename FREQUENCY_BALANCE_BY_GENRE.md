## ⚠️ Analysis Guidelines

### **Acceptable Variations:**
- Frequency percentages can vary ±5% within genre guidelines
- Creative choices may intentionally deviate from these standards
- Mastering choices depend on target playback systems

### **Red Flags:**
- **Low End >70%:** Likely to cause mud and translation issues
- **High frequencies <2%:** May sound dull or overly filtered
- **Midrange <15%:** Vocals and lead instruments may lack presence
- **Any band >80%:** Extreme imbalance affecting overall clarity

### **Context Considerations:**
- **Streaming platforms:** May require more conservative low end
- **Club/dance music:** Can handle more extreme low end emphasis
- **Radio play:** Benefits from enhanced midrange presence
- **Audiophile releases:** May favor more balanced distribution

## 🎯 How to Use This Guide

1. **Analyze your mix** using the MixDoctor frequency analysis
2. **Compare results** to the appropriate genre guidelines
3. **Identify deviations** that might indicate mixing issues
4. **Consider context** - intentional creative choices vs. technical problems
5. **Make adjustments** if the frequency balance doesn't serve the music

Remember: These are guidelines, not rules. Great music sometimes breaks conventions, but understanding these standards helps identify when deviations are intentional artistic choices versus technical issues.
