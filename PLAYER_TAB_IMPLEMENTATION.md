# Player Tab Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Player tab with play buttons for each song in the Import view, along with a song counter.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created PlayerView.swift
**Location:** `MixDoctor/Features/Player/Views/PlayerView.swift`

A comprehensive audio player interface with the following features:
- **File Information Display**: Shows song name, sample rate, bit depth, and channel configuration
- **Waveform Visualization**: Real-time waveform display with playback progress
- **Playback Controls**:
  - Play/Pause button
  - Skip forward/backward (10 seconds)
  - Playback progress slider
  - Time display (current/total)
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Loop toggle
  - Playback speed control (0.5× to 2.0×)
  - Channel mode selector (Stereo, Left, Right, Mid, Side)
- **Empty State**: Displays when no audio file is selected

### 2. Updated ContentView.swift
**Changes:**
- Added state management for selected audio file and tab selection
- Implemented 4 tabs:
  1. Dashboard (tab 0)
  2. Import (tab 1)
  3. **Player (tab 2)** - NEW
  4. Settings (tab 3)
- Pass bindings to ImportView for navigation coordination

### 3. Enhanced ImportView.swift
**Changes:**
- Added bindings for `selectedAudioFile` and `selectedTab`
- Updated header to show song count: "X song(s)" instead of "X files imported"
- Modified `ImportedFileRow` to include:
  - Play button icon at the end of each row
  - Tap action that:
    - Sets the selected audio file
    - Automatically switches to Player tab (tab 2)

### 4. Updated ImportedFileRow
**Changes:**
- Restructured layout with HStack to accommodate play button
- Added play button with:
  - `play.circle.fill` SF Symbol
  - 32pt size
  - Primary accent color
  - Tap handler for navigation

## User Experience Flow

1. **Import Tab**:
   - User sees list of imported songs
   - Header shows total count: "5 songs" or "1 song"
   - Each song row has a play button icon on the right

2. **Playing a Song**:
   - User taps play button on any song
   - App automatically switches to Player tab
   - Selected song loads and is ready to play

3. **Player Tab**:
   - Displays full player interface for selected song
   - All playback controls are immediately available
   - Empty state shown when no song is selected

## Technical Details

- **State Management**: Uses SwiftUI `@State` and `@Binding` for reactive updates
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with programmatic tab switching
- **Audio Playback**: Leverages existing `PlayerViewModel` with AVAudioPlayer
- **Data Model**: Uses existing `AudioFile` model with SwiftData
- **UI Components**: Native SwiftUI with SF Symbols for consistent iOS design
